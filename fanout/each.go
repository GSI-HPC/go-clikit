// Package fanout works on many items at once, a bounded number at a time,
// and reports each as a target of the progress package: Each is the one
// bounded loop, Map works on items and reports them as a step with a
// target each, and Batches works on a node set in batches, one after the
// other, with a pause between them.
//
// Every pool keeps the promises progresstest.Check holds an emitter to:
// every target is announced queued before the first runs, each is ended
// before its place is given up, and those never started end canceled, so
// that a display's count reaches its total however the work ends. A panic
// in the work for one item becomes that item's error. The package knows no
// program: its name, the rule that tells an error's class and the error a
// step ends with are Options.
