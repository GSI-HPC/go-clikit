// Package display shows the progress of a command on its standard error,
// from the events of its progress.Bus: the live tree, a few rows at the
// bottom of a terminal that show the work under way and what of it failed;
// the counter, one line there that says how far the work has got; plain
// lines, one for each thing worth a line, for a log as much as a terminal;
// and the summary a display leaves behind once the command has ended.
//
// The tree and the counter own the bottom rows of the terminal, the region,
// and nothing else. The command's own output goes to the terminal through
// the writers of the Terminal, which take the region off before anything
// else is written, and let it back only once what was written ended a line,
// so that a question waiting for its answer is never drawn over. The lines
// a display leaves for good, plain lines and the tree's finished steps, go
// out through the Terminal too: above the region, never into a line the
// command has not ended, and ahead of whatever the command writes after the
// events they tell of. A display leaves the terminal altogether while a
// question is asked, through progress.Suspend, and never hides the cursor,
// so a process killed while it draws leaves a terminal that works, at worst
// with the rows of its last frame on it.
//
// Lines from goroutines that run beside the command, the stack of a panic
// a pool's worker recovered from or a log line, go through the Terminal's
// Lines writers, which hold them, whole lines only, while a question is
// asked or the command has a line open, so that none lands inside the
// question, and write them above the region once they may.
